# Decentralized Smart City of Things (DSCoT)

Decentralized Smart City of Things (DSCoT) a proposed web3-based architecture, has been developed by leveraging decentralized technologies such as blockchain, 
smart contracts (SCs), and decentralized applications (dApps). The proof-of-concept has been deployed on private and public blockchain testnet i.e., HyperLedger Besu 
and Goerli testnet respectively. 

The ERC721 standard defines Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) which refer to any asset linked to a distinctive cryptographic record, usually a piece of art and luxury item, 
services in terms of music, real estate, collectibles, or another presumed valuable object. The current version of the ERC721 standard does not define functions and 
components to represent the identification and authentication of assets for cyber-physical systems in smart cities. 

Since the blockchain-based architectures for the representation of admin, users, edge, and fog devices utilizing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the literature are 
explicitly lacking, the proposed DSCoT (Decentralized Smart City of Things) devises newly defined attributes for representation and authentication from a software 
standpoint.
