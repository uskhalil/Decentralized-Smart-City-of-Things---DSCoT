# Decentralized-Smart-City-of-Things-DSCoT


ABSTRACT
A decentralized smart city is an innovative urban concept that utilizes Web3 technology to enhance city operations and improve the quality of life for its residents. By leveraging decentralized technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps), a decentralized smart city can offer greater transparency, security, and efficiency in managing urban resources such as energy, water, and waste. In this article, a proposed web3-based architecture, Decentralized Smart City of Things (DSCoT) has been presented with smart contracts development and the deployment of DSCoT on private and public blockchain testnet. Since non-fungibility provided by the ERC721 standard for the smart cities components such as the owner, users, and IoT-enabled smart devices in the literature is explicitly missing, the proposed web3 architecture DSCoT devised the functionality of identification and authentication of the assets in a smart city. The code utilizes smart contracts to develop the identification and authentication mechanism which generates the NFT-based authentication access code to authorize access for the assets in the smart city concept.
